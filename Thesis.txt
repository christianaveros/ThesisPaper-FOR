As much as we can, we bargain, bargain, and bargain, most modern Filipino women would go to mall after mall just to buy off on-sale product which is also true for old-fashion mothers who would prefer to bargain just to get deals from their market suppliers. In today’s technological advantage, many shopper prefer e-commerce as their mode of shopping [Kitonyi, 2017]. // problem in e-commerce, insert here bgots in slides

1.3 Conceptual Framework

	1.3.1	Conceptual Framework of the System

	// insert accuracy related concepts

	TABLE FORM:
	input > user’s search terms, OSW. Process > search the terms at osw using data mining, filtering item to display the best deals. Output > Best deals.

1.4 Statement of the Problem

	This study aims to develop a system that gets the best deal from various online shopping websites based on user’s search terms. // getting // finding out the deals, algo // accuracy of the results

		1.Using the *algo1* algorithm, what is the accuracy of getting the relevant data from online shopping websites? // insert in conclusion, the percentage of accuracy.
		
		2.How should the algorithm be devised in order to get the best deals out of the listed relevant product? And:
			a.What is the accuracy of the devised algorithm of getting the best deals?
			b.What is the reliability of the algorithm in getting the right best deals?
