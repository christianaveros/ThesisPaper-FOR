Chapter 1

1.1 Introduction

	In the fast-paced modern world, where technology progresses rampantly, we try to keep
up with today's trends as well as needs. With the rise of technology, clinging unto technology makes our lives 
easier, and some experts say that the internet can now be consider a need along with food and shelter 
[Roper Starch Worldwide and America Online, Inc., 1998]. Everything is being digitalized as for our communication 
and work-processes, and with the use of the internet and its rapid development, delivery systems are getting 
more and more popular along side of online shopping websites (OSW). With that being said, it has a great affect 
on us, Filipinos, especially modern Filipina buy products on the internet through OSW. 

	Most people all over the Philippines have access to the internet and they are still growing in numbers
but there's a problem, how can we diminish the hardwork process of search through many OSWs just to get the best 
deals? As a Filipino, I'm used to seeing my mother go through many store just to get the optimal price that  
fits in our budget, sometimes, we even come to a point of bargaining or asking the store to lower the price
if we're going to buy bulk of their products. Users would search for many websites to compare and analyze what is
the best for their searched similar products, weighing in the reviews, quantity, and even quality just to make sure
that they're making a good decision upon purchasing such product. Therefore, the researchers decided to develop a system
to help with troubled online shoppers (OS).

1.2 Background of the Study

	//background

	Most Filipino shoppers have a hard time jumping to another store into other store just to find the best deals 
of their wanted product, may it be a new pair of shoes, shining jeans, or maybe a newly released branded cap. As much
as we can, we bargain, bargain, and bargain, most modern Filipino women would go to mall after mall just to buy off 
on-sale product which is also true for old-fashion mothers who would prefer to bargain just to get deals from their 
market suppliers. In today’s technological advantage, many shoppers prefer e-commerce as their mode of shopping 
[Kitonyi, 2017], primarily because internet is easy to access and buying is just a click away. // problem in e-commerce, 
insert here bgots in slides

// say some filipino related things here like we like to bargain, inheritly.
// say here the manual hardwork process of compared similar products
// the problem of buying from secondhand promoting online stores, *include a study here about that*
// include here some more studies of the same type. highlight the pros, what went good.
// then the ones that need improvements
// the main features needed (or what features we are intended to add)
// say that we will build that.

1.3 Conceptual Framework

	1.3.1	Conceptual Framework of the System

	// insert accuracy related concepts

	TABLE FORM:
	input > user’s search terms, OSW. Process > search the terms at osw using data mining, filtering item to display the best deals. Output > Best deals.

1.4 Statement of the Problem

	This study aims to develop a system that gets the best deal from various online shopping websites based on user’s search terms. // getting // finding out the deals, algo // accuracy of the results

		1. Using the a-priori algorithm, what is the accuracy of getting the relevant data from online shopping websites? // insert in conclusion, the percentage of accuracy.
		
		2. How should the algorithm be devised in order to get the best deals out of the listed relevant product?

		3. What is the accuracy and reliabiity of the devised algorithm in getting the best deals?

1.5 Significance of the Study

	The system will benefit the following people:

		Online Shoppers. This study would benefit shoppers who wants to lessen their time on selecting the best deal.

		Store Owners. This will benefit them by being able to search how they would price their own products.
		
		Future Researchers. This study will be a help as a guiding reference in making a system related to e-commerce.

1.6 Scope and Delimitation

	1.6.1	Scope and Limitation of the System
		The system will mine data from popular retailer online shopping websites and will not include second hand online shopping websites, specifically:
			1. Lazada (lazada.com.ph)
			2. Shopee (shopee.ph)
			3. Amazon (amazon.com)
			4. Zalora (zalora.com.ph)
		The scope in assessing the best deals will base on the relevancy, availability, price including the shipping fee, specifications, and numerical reviews regarding the product. The product prices will be displayed in Philippine Peso.

		The system will not be affiliated in selling products and will only act as an recommender system for finding the best deals.
		
	1.6.2	Scope and Limitation of the Study
		This study will focus on the accuracy of the finding the best deals of a product selected by the user at the top online shopping websites.
