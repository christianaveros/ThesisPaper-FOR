// justifies that despite the presence of a multitude of studies
what is being proposed is unique and worth pursuing.

There have been several studies conducted in the field of painting classification. However, most
of the researches focused only on painter identification and authentication and some are style
specific. In this study, the researchers attempt to classify the digital captures of paintings using 6
different styles such as Baroque, Impressionism, Abstract, Cubism, Expressionism, and Pop art.
It was cited in the related literature that choosing the appropriate feature is essential to increase
the effectiveness of a particular learning algorithm. Similar to the previous studies, the study
undergoes two process, feature extraction and classification. For the feature extraction stage, the
global and local characteristics of the paintings were extracted from the image. For the global
features, the researchers applied the method used by [Zujovic et al. 2009] which includes the edge,
texture and color component of the painting. On the other hand, the researcher used the Bag-ofWords
model representation for the local features, the same approach used in the study of [Khan et
al. 2014] and [Arora and Elgammal 2012]. The researchers will determine if combining such features
of the painting used in the previous studies will yield a higher accuracy when it comes to the
classification by style.
Given the set of features, the researchers need to build proper classifier to combine the features
together. Among all the algorithms used, the researchers used Naïve Bayes algorithm as our
classifier. Based on the studies mentioned above, Naïve Bayes performed as one of the best
classifier. Furthermore, the cited researches about painting analysis and classification by style are
not that accurate and mostly are foreign studies.
