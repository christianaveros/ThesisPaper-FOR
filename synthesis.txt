// justifies that despite the presence of a multitude of studies
what is being proposed is unique and worth pursuing.

There have been several studies conducted in the field of painting classification. However, most
of the researches focused only on painter identification and authentication and some are style
specific. In this study, the researchers attempt to classify the digital captures of paintings using 6
different styles such as Baroque, Impressionism, Abstract, Cubism, Expressionism, and Pop art.
It was cited in the related literature that choosing the appropriate feature is essential to increase
the effectiveness of a particular learning algorithm. Similar to the previous studies, the study
undergoes two process, feature extraction and classification. For the feature extraction stage, the
global and local characteristics of the paintings were extracted from the image. For the global
features, the researchers applied the method used by [Zujovic et al. 2009] which includes the edge,
texture and color component of the painting. On the other hand, the researcher used the Bag-ofWords
model representation for the local features, the same approach used in the study of [Khan et
al. 2014] and [Arora and Elgammal 2012]. The researchers will determine if combining such features
of the painting used in the previous studies will yield a higher accuracy when it comes to the
classification by style.
Given the set of features, the researchers need to build proper classifier to combine the features
together. Among all the algorithms used, the researchers used Naïve Bayes algorithm as our
classifier. Based on the studies mentioned above, Naïve Bayes performed as one of the best
classifier. Furthermore, the cited researches about painting analysis and classification by style are
not that accurate and mostly are foreign studies.


There have been many studies that concerns in the field of datamining and visualization. One of the
main researches that drives the researchers is the 'Comparison of E-commerce products in using web mining' research
done in Savitribai Phule Pune University in where the users inputs two or more products to compare in a
single page website [****include number for rl****]. However, the main problem is that the users are required to search for such products
for it to compare.  In this study, the researchers attempt to gather data from the leading OSWs automatically
responding the search terms or input of the users. Using the input of the user, the system then will
collect products related to the input from the OSWs and finally, displayed according to their ranking.
As a decision support system, the system focuses on visualizing the products in a way that help convey the
difference among the products as well as magnify the pros and cons.

For the gathering data relevant to the desired product of the user, the researchers used A priori algorithm
for getting the frequent relevant itemsets [****include here the number directing to Apriori algorithm****].
The prune data in will be then subjected to an algorithm called Interleaved ranking algorithm with bayesian
estimation to find the best deals to be visualize in a single view page. For the visualization, the users
can view graphs and statistics which can help in deciding on what to buy.
