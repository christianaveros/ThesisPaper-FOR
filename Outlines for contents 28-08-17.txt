3.1 Research method used

// Discuss here how the respondents will navigate and how if the output is 'accurate' and 'reliable'

	TIPid: Decision Support System on E-Shopping Products through Graphical Visualization and Data Mining is a system
in which helps the users decide on what to buy on OSWs. The system will be given search terms by the researchers and then will
evaluate the accuracy of the output product.

3.2 Research Paradigm

// Grapical presentation of the 'testing' of the system as well as the flow of the 'testing'

3.3 System Architecture

// Graphical presentation of the flow of the system

	3.3.1 Preprocessing

	// system process to be readied in the Main process. ex. DM from OSWs
		The respondents will input search terms data in which the system will crawl through the scoped OSWs with the search 
	terms as 'seed' or the primary 

	3.3.2 Main Process
	
	// system process to be done. comparing, removing redundant data, choosing best deals out of many deals, packaging it to be displayed in batch
	The scraped data will be structured and compared using a-priori algorithm. The output will/is consists of 'best deals'

	3.3.3 Post process

	// output product. Display the content. User interface, VISUALIZATION!!
	The 'best deals' will be then displayed in a single-view webpage in which helps the respondents // elaborate

3.4 Population Frame and Sample

// Discuss here where we will get the data, OSWs.
// discuss here the limit of the output file. ex. 10 datasets from X data mined data

3.5 Description of the Respondents

	The respondents is the research as they will give search terms and will evaluate the accuracy and reliability
// describe here who is the respondents or the one who gives the accuracy of the system
// in our case, it is us, the researchers/others because we feed in data to the system and have to
// evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the output product.

3.6 Sampling Technique

// used by the researchers 

3.7 Intrumentation

// discuss here all the software used, django, python, crawler, webmining
// platforms involved, OSWs, scopes & limitation
// what the system inputs and outputs are
// how the algorithm is used, a priori algo, in what way
// recall statistical formulas in 3.9
// how the experiment is structured, what it's composed of, variables in play
// again discussing how those variables to be included. explained.

3.8 Data Gathering Procedure

// Elaborate here how the Data gathering (DG) process used by the researchers
// include here an example data sets or preset data for a quick process of DG


3.9 Statistical Treatment

// Measurements of accuracy and reliabity formulas here
// and elaborate how does those variables come in to play
// also, include the translation of acronyms to be used in the formula ex. ar = accuracy rate, tp = true positive, Excellent = greater than 0.9, etc.
