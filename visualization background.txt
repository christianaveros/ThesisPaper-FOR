	Visualization is the representation of data in which is any technique for creating images, animations, and etc. to
convey a message. Truly, life would be boring if there weren't many colors or shapes around. Both became one of the major 
tools in life for differentiating and comparing. In today's application of visualization, one of the tools it is used for, 
when it comes to websites and computer applications, is helping the users' on their experiences. It help them in the form
of 'navigation', or even the color and theme of the website to give more feeling of appropriate based on the contents.

support system in which colors and shape helps in choosing one in the items in question. ------------------ Add here the last paragraph in bgots -----
