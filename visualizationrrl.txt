Visualization provides user an comprehensive understanding about a data. It gives form to raw data making it coherent to the users. Using computer graphic effects, data sets can be visualized to display patterns, relationship and trends in a more advanced way. This gives a users an ease to apprehend information by the use of visual reasoning rather than numerical reasoning. [1] Presentation of data may involve the manipulation of graphical entities and attributes. A good data visualization must consider the effectiveness or ease of interpretation, accuracy or correct quantitative evaluation, efficiency or data redundancy removal, aesthetic or must be pleasant to the user's eye and adaptable or adjustable to serve multiple needs. Common techniques on data visualization are following: charts, graphs, plots, maps, images, 3D surfaces and animation. [2] There are common steps followed in data visualization [3]:
	1) Numerical transformation of data by modifying the distribution in a more sensible way
	2) Data analysis to interpret data that will be used in graphical interpretation
	3) Graphical interpretation by plotting the analyzed data onto graphs and modifying views
	4) User interaction by adding options for users to dynamically adjust mapping, zooming, panning, highlighting, et cetera.
